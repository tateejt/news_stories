## CLI Application

I have created this project, and this is my first CLI application project. I scraped a website with many articles. This application pulls information from the webiste and displays a list of articles, that you can choose from. You then choose a number out of 5 depending on the article you are wanting to read. Once you decide which article you are interested in reading, it will then scrape the article page and print out the articles story. You can choose as many article as you want. If you want to see the list again you can just type "list". 

## Running this program

Run 'ruby bin/latest_story'
